# Euclidean Algorithm

## Overview

The Euclidean Algorithm is a fundamental method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. This ancient algorithm, named after the Greek mathematician Euclid, is essential in number theory and has numerous applications in modern computational mathematics and computer science.

## The Algorithm

The Euclidean Algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here’s a step-by-step description:

1. Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a >= b`, perform the following:
    1. Divide `a` by `b` to find the remainder `r`.
    2. Replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `r`.
    3. Repeat the process until `b` becomes 0. The non-zero value of `a` at this point is the GCD of the original integers.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
function gcd(a, b):
    while b ≠ 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```
## History

- **circa 300 BC**: The Euclidean Algorithm was first described by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in his seminal work *Elements*. It is introduced in Proposition 2 of Book VII, which focuses on properties of divisors and their relationships.
- **Middle Ages**: During this period, the algorithm was further studied and became a key tool in number theory. Its utility in simplifying calculations and proofs made it an essential component of mathematical education and practice.
- **Renaissance and Beyond**: As mathematics progressed, the Euclidean Algorithm continued to play a crucial role in algebra and number theory. It influenced the development of various mathematical concepts and techniques.
- **Modern Era**: Today, the Euclidean Algorithm is fundamental in computational mathematics, particularly in algorithms for integer arithmetic and cryptographic applications. Its efficiency and simplicity have made it a cornerstone of modern mathematical and computational practices.

## Current Applications

The Euclidean Algorithm is widely applied in various fields, including:

- **Computational Mathematics**: Essential for efficiently finding the GCD of large integers, which is crucial in many algorithms and cryptographic systems.
- **Simplifying Fractions**: Used to reduce fractions to their simplest form by determining their GCD.
- **Number Theory**: Central in many proofs and theorems involving divisors and modular arithmetic.
- **Computer Science**: Applied in algorithms for modular arithmetic, error detection, and other computational tasks.

## Variations and Extensions

- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: This variation not only finds the GCD but also computes the coefficients (x, y) in Bézout's identity, satisfying \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
- **Binary GCD Algorithm**: An optimized version that uses binary operations for efficiency, particularly in computational contexts.

## Example

To find the GCD of 48 and 18 using the Euclidean Algorithm:

1. Compute \( 48 \mod 18 = 12 \).
2. Replace (48, 18) with (18, 12).
3. Compute \( 18 \mod 12 = 6 \).
4. Replace (18, 12) with (12, 6).
5. Compute \( 12 \mod 6 = 0 \).
6. Replace (12, 6) with (6, 0).

The GCD is 6.
